## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict **energy production** based on environmental variables such as temperature, exhaust vacuum, ambient pressure, and humidity. Multiple regression-based models are applied, evaluated, and compared to determine the best-performing approach.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains records of power plant energy production and environmental conditions.
- Features include:
  - **Temperature** (Â°C)
  - **Exhaust Vacuum** (cm Hg)
  - **Ambient Pressure** (millibar)
  - **Relative Humidity** (%)
  - **Energy Output** (MW) - Target Variable

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

- **Handling missing values** (if any)
- **Removing duplicate entries**
- **Detecting and treating outliers**
- **Scaling & Normalization** (MinMaxScaler/StandardScaler)
- **Splitting into train and test sets**

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Correlation heatmaps** to examine relationships between features
- **Scatter plots** to visualize dependencies
- **Residual plots** to analyze model fit
- **Histograms & Boxplots** to inspect distributions and outliers

## Feature Selection

To select the most relevant features and reduce redundancy, we apply:

- **Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet Regression**
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**
- **Mutual Information-based selection**
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis** to check for multicollinearity

## Models Implemented

Several regression models are implemented and compared:

1. **Linear Regression** (OLS & sklearn implementation)
2. **Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet Regression**
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Regression**
4. **Decision Tree Regression**
5. **Polynomial Regression**
6. **Random Forest Regression**
7. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

## Performance Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**
- **Adjusted RÂ² Score**
- **Feature importance analysis** (for tree-based models)

## Results and Insights

- The **Random Forest Regression** model achieved the best performance with high RÂ² and low RMSE.
- **Polynomial Regression** improved performance but at the cost of complexity.
- **PCA reduced dimensionality**, but minor information loss impacted prediction accuracy.
- **Lasso Regression** proved effective for feature selection by eliminating insignificant variables.
- **SVR required extensive hyperparameter tuning** but performed competitively.
